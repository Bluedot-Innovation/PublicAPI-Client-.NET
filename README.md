PublicApi-.net-client
=====================

Bluedot Public APIs expose the functionality of the backend system - Bluedot Point Access - that is usually accessed via the web user interface, as RESTful JSON web services. Data added through the Public APIs can be edited via the Web Interface - Bluedot Point Access and vice versa  The key requirements to begin the integration are: Register an account on Point Access by visiting the Bluedot website. (www.bluedotinnovation.com). Activate your account by selecting the link in the activation email that is sent to the registered email address. A second email will be sent confirming that your account has been activated and providing a Customer API Key. This key can also be found at any time under 'Edit Profile' (in the 'Account Management' tab on the Point Access Dashboard). This key is needed for authentication.
